JSP project - Scrorching Blogs

This is a finished project. Sort of. I know there are a lot of things
to fix one hand but on the other all the basic functionality is there.
I guess a code cleanup wouldn't hurt but then again I'm kinda proud
that this project works without even a hint of TDD or somesuch.

I read a JSP book on a saturday. I started coding the next monday and
continued so until next monday when I turned it in. I'm kinda proud
it all works as well as it does as it was the first time for a lot of
things including using Eclipse rather than Kate as editor.

An actual SQL dump wasn't included. I seem to have lost that at the
moment but the ER and code pretty much says how it should be set up.
